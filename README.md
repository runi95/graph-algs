A 3D visualization tool used to render different pathfinding algorithms.

ðŸ“ƒ Note: A grid like the one used in this repository is likely not the best way to evaluate pathfinding algorithms for *your* exact use case and should thus only be used as an approximation tool. The 3D grid is mostly for simplicity and visualization purposes.

## Currently supported pathfinding algorithms
- Depth first search
- Breath first search
- Dijkstra
- A\*
- D\* Lite
- Lifelong Planning A\*
- Theta\*
- Lazy Theta\*

## Currently supported heuristics
- Manhattan distance
- Canberra distance
- Euclidean distance
- Octile distance
- Chebyshev distance
